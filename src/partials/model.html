          NVF supports social sector innovations that lead to better outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Funders care about solving social problems and are looking for ways to make significant progress. They want to try new things. They increasingly recognize that traditional grantmaking processes are often too slow to keep up with the times and may create distance between them and the projects they support, and even perpetuate past inequities. In this context, many funders now favor — and seek out — more direct partnerships with other funders, social entrepreneurs and nonprofits leading like-minded public interest projects on the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is where NVF comes in. We help execute a range of public interest projects on issues such as conservation, global health, public policy, international development, education, disaster recovery and the arts. In partnership with funders and in support of social change initiatives, we provide a flexible backbone of support services, guidance and extra hands to move collaborative efforts forward efficiently and effectively.
