          From 2013-2018, we partnered with 8,067 donors. The vast majority of our funding comes from foundations, more than half of which are among the 50 largest grantmaking foundations in the United States. Individuals and families follow, then corporations. A small percentage of funding comes from community groups, associations and nonprofit organizations. The vast majority of our donors are public, while a few choose to remain anonymous, often to keep the focus on the work being done. In this time period, we have made 4,919 subgrants. Graphic 1 presents a breakdown of New Venture Fundâ€™s sources over the past five years. Graphic 2 demonstrates our funding growth since 2006.
