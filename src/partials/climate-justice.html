        Another good example of building to scale without getting bogged down is our partner the Climate Justice Resilience Fund (CJRF).

        At the 2018 Global Climate Action Summit, women from Africa had a prominent voice. Several of the most prominent environmental female speakers were there because of CJRF. These women demanded to be heard, and rightfully so.

        They represented some of the places most threatened by the climate crisis, and they advocated that those who have the most responsibility for the emissions causing climate change shoulder the greatest responsibility for the costs of emissions reduction. Their presence at the summit was a strong signal of CJRF’s growing stature on the global stage.

        CJRF was formed to help women, youth and indigenous peoples create, share and scale local solutions for resilience in the face of climate change. Together with frontline communities, CJRF is building a dynamic movement of people creating, demonstrating and advocating for smart solutions to climate change.

        With support from NVF, CJRF has moved funds quickly to distant countries requiring help without forcing communities to jump through complicated bureaucratic hoops. In Bangladesh, for example, intense storms and rising sea levels are making it increasingly difficult for local farmers to earn a living. CJRF recently granted $1 million to HELVETAS, an independent Swiss development organization that is building capacity in Africa, Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe for its “Water is Life” project. CJRF’s grant is designed to help family farms on the coast of Bangladesh that are struggling to protect crops from excessive salt in the soil as a result of sea-level rise. With damaged crops, farmers find it difficult to produce enough food, sparking a series of events that leave vulnerable families open to further calamities. Husbands are forced to abandon their farms in search of other work, while women are left at home with limited resources to tend to the farm and protect their children. Grants like these help CJRF pursue its goal of ensuring that women, youth and indigenous peoples have the resources they need to determine and build the solutions that will work best for them and their families.
