        The National Collaborative for Health Equity (NCHE) had bold ideas to create more equitable neighborhoods, economic opportunities and environments for kids to grow up in and thrive. Health equity is the notion that everyone ought to have a fair and just opportunity to achieve their best possible health. It’s a simple concept, though the solutions are complex. NCHE focuses on communities that are disproportionately impacted by systemic and historical barriers that create grave disparities in their health outcomes. At birth, black and Latinx babies have higher rates of infant mortality and low birth weight. Young people of color have higher risks for diseases as they enter adulthood, leading to shorter lives. NCHE exists to reverse these trends and is guided by the belief that to achieve sustainable racial equity and racial healing, we will all have to engage all communities.

        It started with a relatively modest start-up grant of $500,000. NCHE knew it needed to grow this start-up grant into a sustainable fund, it needed to get money to front-line communities, and it needed to be at the table with the influential donors who were deciding whom to join forces with and where to focus. It needed a partner to help it learn how to do this. NCHE credits NVF’s reliable counsel on how to manage its projects, how to raise and distribute grant funds and how to implement programs and initiatives in the most efficient way possible. Because of its early success, NCHE also prevailed over more-established organizations to become a co-lead for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s Culture of Health leadership program.

        Now led by Dr. Gail C. Christopher, former senior advisor and vice president of the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, NCHE remains a visionary organization. At the local level, NCHE works with advocates who are improving the retail food environment so that people have healthier food options. Nationally, NCHE is working on issues like clean air and water so that children grow up in healthy environments. NCHE also partners with groups that are creating more just communities where neighbors are not fearful that they will be unfairly entangled in the criminal justice system. Last year, NCHE leaders testified in support of a bill in the Maryland legislature to establish a task force on racial reconciliation and equity. NCHE assisted advocates who fought for and won a $15 minimum wage in Cook County, Illinois. And in King County, Washington, NCHE’s team helped advocates build support for a county-wide equity and social justice ordinance requiring the county to prioritize equity and social justice in all of its policymaking. It was one of the first jurisdictions in the nation to do so.

        NVF frees up donors and leaders to focus.
      </p>

      <p>
        Giving donors and leaders the ability to focus leads to powerful outcomes. They can start organizations with us in a matter of weeks. They can focus on testing their concept rather than building a structure that may or may not be the best one, often overpaying for basic services. For organizations that want to get something done and then sunset, we offer a way to do that responsibly. For those that want to become independent, we have a transition process that makes this seamless. Whatever the organization’s future, we give them a strong start.
